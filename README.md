# Usability testing
*What do you need: 1-2 weeks, a specific feauture or process, someone to lead the test & analyze results, ~5 participants or subjects*

## What is a usability test?
Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users. Typically, during a test, participants will try to complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen and takes notes.  The goal is to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data and determine the participant's satisfaction with the product.

To run an effective usability test, you need to develop a solid test plan, recruit participants , and then analyze and report your findings.

#### Types of Users 
1. **Hallway Testing:** Grab anyone who is unfamiliar with the application or website you're testing. These can be co-workers, friends, family or folks at Starbucks.  Hallway testing works well for general purpose websites or apps and when you're looking to uncover the more obvious problems with the interactions (problems, of course, always seem obvious after you find them).  
Don't rely too heavily on this method, especially when the design is more refined or users have specialized skills. When users don't have an interest in a product or service they will be happy to give you an opinion on matters but relying on them may generate false positive and miss issues actual users will encounter.

2. **Existing Users:** Your existing users are an obvious wellspring for testing. For new products, there are by definition no users, so this isn't always something you can rely on. But, if your company makes similar products, then it makes sense to leverage customers that might know the domain.  Finding existing users off your website is an easy place to start. You can use pop-ups (offered by UserZoom and Ethnio) or fixed opt-in boxes to solicit volunteers.  Marketing and sales departments usually have customer contact information you can tap. 
You can also try working with the customer support department and asking participants if they'd be interested in participating in follow-up studies. While existing customers sound like a panacea for finding users, we find not all volunteers have the time or availability to commit to an hour-long study, so you often have to rely on other sources.

3. **Usertesting.com:** The popular website testing service Usertesting.com not only delivers audio and video of users using a website or mobile app, it also has a large panel of users. Usertesting.com allows you to recruit based on age, gender and geography. You can also ask participants to self-select by asking them only to participate if they've used a certain website, own a particular product, have health insurance, or have a 401k account, among other things. While it's not a solution for when you need hundreds of responses or very specific recruiting criteria, getting a source of users and a 15-20 minute usability testing for under $40 is often very effective.
